## Overview
I created this in 2016 as part of a freeCodeCamp challenge. This site allows you to easily watch several of your favorite streamers by integrating with the Twitch API.

The Twitch API has completely changed since this was made, so I am used a [cached version provided by freeCodeCamp](https://twitch-proxy.freecodecamp.rocks/) for these legacy projects. You will notice that some of the streamer icons don't load, or other features are wonky. This is all due to the API changes.

## Things Learned
This was one of the first websites I built that integrated with an API. A couple highlights include:
- Fetching the Twitch API
- Using the response on the actual page using jQuery
- Async JavaScript
- CORS requests
- Embedding video files responsively
